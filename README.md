## About Me

Hello! My name is **Shalini Shalu**, and I am 20 years old. I’m a passionate **Full Stack Front-End Developer** from Goa, with a love for bringing creative visions to life through vibrant web designs.

I enjoy diving deep into coding challenges, especially when it comes to crafting elegant and interactive websites that captivate users. Building the perfect interface is my art, and coding is my tool.

While web development is my primary passion, I also have a unique interest in exploring the fascinating world of viruses, which fuels my curiosity and drive to learn.

When I’m not coding, I’m usually experimenting with new ideas, improving my skills, and pushing the boundaries of web design. 

Let’s connect and create something amazing together!
